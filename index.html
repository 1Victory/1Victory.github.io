	<h3>Ten things to do to be successful now:</h3>
	<p class="p1"><h4>
One of the most important ways you can be successful in life is to find meaning in what you are doing. To live in a way where your
behaviors matter. Where you feeling like you are accomplishing something. And one of the most startling things about doing this is:
Anyone can do it. Take Steven hawkins, or ... or...... These are not remarkable people in the sense that they are different from
a regular person. They have just had profound meaning attached to there actions. </p>

THE SECRET TO BEING SUCCESFUL

Define what Success is to you.
You may be working in an area with others and have set up your expectation for success, say for example you work in 
a job that you get paid to complete projects and your fellow workers also work to complete the same type of projects. 
You have set your goal to be the top project completer in the company but time and time again another worker continually completes
more projects than you. One day finally you are getting ready to through up your hands and just say I've done all I can to 
be the best but keep getting beat out. But instead of labeling yourself as an inferiour employee you come to the realization
that you have been taking more time to get to know other people and have been taking more time with your friends and family off
of work than the person who has been higher numbers. You realize that success to you is really to achieve an incredible amount
of production on the job but also be incredibly successful in relationships.</h4>
