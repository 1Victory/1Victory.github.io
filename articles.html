	<h3>DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SLEEP YOUR LIFE AWAY??</h3>
	<h3>Ten things to do to be successful now:</h3>
	<p class="p1"><h4>
One of the most important ways you can be successful in life is to find meaning in what you are doing. To live in a way where your
behaviors matter. Where you feeling like you are accomplishing something. And one of the most startling things about doing this is:
Anyone can do it. Take Steven hawkins, or ... or...... These are not remarkable people in the sense that they are different from
a regular person. They have just had profound meaning attached to there actions. </p>

THE SECRET TO BEING SUCCESFUL

Define what Success is to you.
You may be working in an area with others and have set up your expectation for success, say for example you work in 
a job that you get paid to complete projects and your fellow workers also work to complete the same type of projects. 
You have set your goal to be the top project completer in the company but time and time again another worker continually completes
more projects than you. One day finally you are getting ready to through up your hands and just say I've done all I can to 
be the best but keep getting beat out. But instead of labeling yourself as an inferiour employee you come to the realization
that you have been taking more time to get to know other people and have been taking more time with your friends and family off
of work than the person who has been higher numbers. You realize that success to you is really to achieve an incredible amount
of production on the job but also be incredibly successful in relationships.</h4>

	<p>"Maslow (1943) stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs.
	When one need is fulfilled a person seeks to fullfil the next one, and so on.

The earliest and most widespread version of Maslow's (1943, 1954) hierarchy of needs 
includes five motivational needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid
his five stage model can be divided into basic (or deficiency) needs (e.g. physiological, 
safety, love, and esteem) and growth needs (self-actualization).
The deficiency, or basic needs are said to motivate people when they are unmet. Also, the need to 
fulfil such needs will become stronger the longer the duration they are denied. For example, the longer a person 
goes without food the more hungry they will become
One must satisfy lower level basic needs before progressing on to meet higher level growth needs. 
Once these needs have been reasonably satisfied, one may be able to reach the highest level called self-actualization.
Every person is capable and has the desire to move up the hierarchy toward a level of self-actualization. 
Unfortunately, progress is often disrupted by failure to meet lower level needs. Life experiences including divorce and 
loss of job may cause an individual to fluctuate between levels of the hierarchy.
Maslow noted only one in a hundred people become fully self-actualized because our society 
rewards motivation primarily based on esteem, love and other social needs.
The original hierarchy of needs five-stage model includes:
1. Biological and Physiological needs - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep.
2. Safety needs - protection from elements, security, order, law, stability, freedom from fear.
3. Love and belongingness needs - friendship, intimacy, affection and love, - from work group, family, friends, romantic relationships.
4. Esteem needs - achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, self-respect, respect from others.
5. Self-Actualization needs - realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.</p>
